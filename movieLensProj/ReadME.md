This project creates a collaborative filtering model to predict missing movie ratings from users using SoftImpute. 

      The MovieLens Dataset

MovieLens is a non-commercial web-based movie recommender system, created in 1997 by GroupLens, a research lab at the University of Minnesota, in order to gather movie rating data for research purposes. Here is the link to this data: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ . Several versions are available. I will use the latest smallest dataset released. This version has 100,836 observations, and there variables: userId, movieId, rating.
